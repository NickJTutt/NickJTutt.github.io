# Nick's Project Website

Hi there, I am Nick Tutt.
I have recently completed my Masters in Mechanical Engineering at Stellenbosch University. During my time I found and came up with some great project ideas to play around with.

In my advantage this consists of both physically built projects and other code based  projects. Hopefully this website will be able to showcase both in a somewhat useful manner.

Please feel free to browse and should you have any questions send me an email at [here](/info@rndmhldngs.co.za/).
